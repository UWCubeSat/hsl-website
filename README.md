## Husky Satellite Lab Code of Conduct

The Husky Satellite Lab is a community of students, mentors, and supporters that relies on continuous collaboration to reach our goals. Our team is guided by a group of core principles:

### Our Mission:
The Husky Satellite Lab’s mission is to establish and grow the space presence of the University of Washington. We are committed to pushing the boundaries of space and student engineering through satellite technology.

### Our People:
The team is a community of people from all types of backgrounds, including different majors, countries, and experience levels. We strive to create a place that is welcoming and inclusive to inspire all students to make their mark in space.

### Our Learning Space:
Our team is a place that encourages learning and pushing your educational boundaries. We take on students of all knowledge and experience levels because we believe that one of the best ways to learn is through hands-on experience. Every opportunity at the Husky Satellite Lab is an opportunity to grow.

### Our Partners:
Our team is supported by many groups- the NASA Space Grant, the University of Washington’s faculty and staff, many sponsors, alumni, and more. All of our successes are supported by many people working behind the scenes with the students, and we are thankful for them and the opportunities they give us.


We have codified a list of conduct standards in order to ensure all our members are upholding our core principles. As a member of the Husky Satellite Lab, you commit to the following code.

As a member of the Husky Satellite Lab, I will:

- Support the team’s mission
- Use my time to facilitate the growth of Husky Satellite Lab projects
- Act with integrity and respect towards others
- Respect materials belonging to the lab
- Respect materials that do not belong to the lab but are in the lab space/nearby
- Follow guidelines the club is subject to set by ITAR
- Support the growth of other members
- Respect guidelines and rules set out by the University of Washington

Should a member fail to behave in ways consistent with the code of conduct, the administrative team will make appropriate actions depending on the severity of the infraction. The Husky Satellite Lab follows a “strikes” system. Minor infractions will result in a strike, and at three strikes, the member will be asked to leave the team. Each strike will be accompanied by a notification by an administrator and an explanation of the infraction.

The Husky Satellite Lab has a zero tolerance harassment policy, and harassment or discrimination will immediately be met with expulsion from the team. The administrative team may also ask members to leave the team at their own discretion before three strikes are reached, should a major violation of the code of conduct occur.
