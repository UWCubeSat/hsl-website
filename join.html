        <a class="anchor" id="sponsor"></a>
        <p>
          The Husky Satellite Lab would not be able to do the work
          it does without our sponsors. The Husky Satellite Lab has
          received hardware, software, and financial sponsorships
          from companies in the aerospace and engineering industries.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are 100% student run, and in an effort to stay as
          independent as possible, we are always looking for funding
          from outside sources.
        </p>

    </h1>

    <div class="text-block">
      <p>Building a satellite is a highly interdisciplinary undertaking.</p>
      <p>There are two main types of work:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Engineering:</b> designing and building the satellite, including software, electronics, and hardware</li>
        <li><b>Business:</b> managing documentation, resources, and interactions</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You do not need to be familiar with all of the topics listed!
        Instead, consider it a guide for the kinds of work and projects that would
        best fit you based on your interest in learning those topics. Previous experience is a bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you are interested in controls engineering and have taken
        courses on circuits and differential equations, you might enjoy
        the software and electrical work on Reaction Wheels & Magnetorquers.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Business
        <a href="#business" class="anchor" id="business"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>
      </h2>

      <p>
        Successfully getting a satellite to space takes more than good engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also takes good business administration: feedback, proposals, finance, and outreach
        are all critical to an enjoyable and productive team culture. Thus, you don't need to be an engineer
        or scientist to make a big impact at HSL! Of course, folks working on business are always welcome
        to explore technical work, and vice versa.
      </p>

      <h3>Mission Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        A key part of the mission's success is running regular reviews of our mission with external
        reviewers to find potential issues and solutions to them early on. That includes a Merit Review
        (ensuring our mission has a good scientific and/or technological value)
        as well as a Feasibility Review (can we pull it off?).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connecting with industry professionals to organize review meetings</li>
        <li>Becoming familiar with all aspects of our team, mission, and satellite's design</li>
        <li>Planning collection and application of feedback, especially seeking critical feedback about our mission</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mission Proposals</h3>
      <p>
        In order to obtain funding and a launch slot to get to space, we submit mission proposals
        to NASA & other organizations describing our mission's vision, the value of the mission,
        and our plan for executing it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing a detail-oriented in-depth report on our mission plan</li>
        <li>Seeing and working with all aspects of the mission</li>
        <li>Carefully ensuring requirements are met for a high-stakes paper</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Funding, Sponsor Relations, and Purchasing</h3>
      <p>
        Solid financial organization is necessary for the success of the HSL. We are
        funded through a combination of grants and sponsorships, and we need to carefully
        account for and communicate our use of resources throughout the mission.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finding new sources of funding</li>
        <li>Letting existing supporters know how their resources are being put to use</li>
        <li>Managing budgets and purchases</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Marketing, Communications, and Recruiting</h3>
      <p>
        It would be fantastic if more of the world knew about the cool work we do!
        Whether it's communicating with people who are already interested in the HSL
        or finding people who are not yet aware of our team, outreach is important.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Managing our online presence (website, social media, newsletter)</li>
        <li>Making materials that promote the team and our work (videos, posters, etc.)</li>
        <li>Connecting interested people with our team</li>
      </ul>
