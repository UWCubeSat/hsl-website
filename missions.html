      The HuskySat-1 (HS-1) is a 3U CubeSat designed, built, and tested by the Husky Satellite Lab.
      HS-1's goal was to test two experimental payloads, a pulsed plasma thruster (PPT), and a
      high-frequency K-band communication system, as well as hosting an Amateur Radio Linear Transponder.
      <br><br>
      HS-1 was developed by an interdisciplinary team at the University of Washington. It was aboard
      NASA's Cygnus NG-12 when it launched on November 2, 2019, and was deployed into Low Earth Orbit
      on January 31, 2020 to become the first amateur, student-built satellite from Washington state.
      <br><br>
      This CubeSat demonstrated the capabilities of new technologies being developed at the
      University of Washington and expanded the capabilities of CubeSats as a whole. In particular,
      the PPT and high-gain communications system formed the core technology suite on board the satellite.
      The HS-1 also flew a newly developed amateur radio linear transponder developed by AMSAT,
      aimed at contributing to the worldwide communication networks built and operated by ham radio enthusiasts.

  <h2>
    PHAT-1
  </h2>
  <a class="anchor" id="phat-1"></a>
  <div class="mission-container">
    <p class="mission-description">
      While satellite launches are the ultimate goal of HSL, sometimes results are needed in a more immediate
      (or at least more cost-effective) method. To accomplish this, we created our first Platform for High
      Altitude Testing (PHAT-1) in the 2018-19 school year. This allowed the team to improve on and experiment
      with the technology used in the HuskySat-1 mission, as well as try out new techniques for future missions.
      <br><br>
      The PHAT-1 mission consisted of two parts: a system bus, containing mission hardware, and a payload section,
      both of which hung below a high altitude balloon. The balloon was then launched to ~90,000 feet. Components
      on the bus included main power, data logging, and controls, as well as a GPS, magnetometer, and altimeter.
      The payload section consisted of a camera, pulsed plasma thruster (PPT) and deployable langmuir probe.
      <br><br>
      Unfortunately, not long after reaching its operational altitude, contact with the PHAT-1 was lost. Flight
      trajectory puts the landing point in the middle of a reservoir near the launch site, so the onboard data
      was never recovered.
      <br><br>
      Still, the mission provided useful insight for future missions. The development of the PPT led to a new
      ignitor/charge board design that is more compact than that used in HuskySat-1&apos;s PPT. The mission opened
      up new ideas for computational software, and the lack of recovery reinforced the need for effective and
      efficient radio transmission.

    <p class="mission-description">
      The Platform for High Altitude Testing (PHAT) is an efficient and economical way for the Husky Satellite Lab to
      continue developing mission level hardware and software. A high-altitude balloon will carry this yearâ€™s payload,
      which includes a Pulsed Plasma Thruster, Langmuir probe, magnetometer, and several component upgrades from the
      previous balloon project, PHAT-1.
      <br><br>
      With a large representation of new members on this mission, PHAT-2 also serves as an excellent learning
      opportunity, providing a first exposure to systems engineering problems of this scale.
      <br><br>
      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PHAT-2 mission has been postponed until further notice.

    <p class="mission-description">
      The scientific objective of this payload is to investigate the effects of a microgravity environment on
      the formation of nanostructures through electrodeposition. Electrodeposition is a common way to produce
      metal coatings on surfaces by running an electric current through a conductive material that is immersed
      in a chemical solution. Along with being used in manufacturing to improve surface characteristics of parts,
      it is also commonly used in the preparation of nanostructures. This is a 2U payload planning to be aboard
      <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/new-shepard/">Blue Origin&apos;s New Shepard</a>.
      <br><br>
      One difficulty when using electrodeposition to form nanostructures is that the precise study of nanostructure
      formation is complicated by convection driven flow in the chemical solution. With gravity-induced fluid flow
      removed, the system will be more stable, possibly leading to more precise or intricate nanostructures to be
      formed. The experimental payload will conduct copper deposition during the time in microgravity, and the
      resulting nanostructures formed will be compared to nanostructures formed using an equivalent control system on
      earth.

      <p>HuskySat-2 (HS-2) is a CubeSat currently under development. It will be a technology demonstrator for cislunar
        and deep space navigation, featuring multiple in-house developed open-source systems including: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/UWCubeSat/lost">LOST</a>: Open-source Star Tracker. Extensively optimized to run
          on low-powered hardware, this piece of software
          identifies on-camera constellations to determine which way the satellite is pointing. It provides a free and
          publicly available alternative to expensive and proprietary solutions.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/UWCubeSat/found">FOUND</a>: Open-source Universal Navigation Determiner. This
          custom-designed system precisely calculates the
          satellite&apos;s orbital trajectory by using a clever algorithm to analyze pictures of the Earth.</li>
        <li>GOOD: Open-source Orientation Driver. A set of four motorized reaction wheels arranged in a pyramidal shape.
          Harnesses the power of Newton&apos;s third law and conservation of momentum to control the cubesat&apos;s orientation
          with pinpoint precision. To rotate the satellite in one direction, the reaction wheels are spun in the
          opposite direction.</li>
        <li>LUCK Utilizing CO2 Kicker. A propulsion system with the purpose of providing sufficient maneuvering capacity to
          reduce a CubeSat's orbit from the Lunar Gateway Station's Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) down to a lower
          science orbit around the moon suitable for HuskySat-3.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These subsystems (and more!) will be open source and publicly accessible. We hope these efforts will lower the
        cost of entry for cubesat builders around the globe. These technologies will be utilized in HuskySat-3, a future
        moon orbiting CubeSat that will map lunar lava tube cave systems using ground penetrating radar.</p>
