  <p class="subtitle limit-width">
    Our sponsors enable us to do out-of-this-world work.
    <br><br>
    We have received hardware, software, and financial sponsorships
    from companies in the aerospace and engineering industries.
    <br><br>
    We are 100% student run, and in an effort to stay as independent
    as possible, we are always looking for funding from outside sources.
